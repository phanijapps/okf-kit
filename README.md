# okf-kit

**Build and serve [Open Knowledge Format](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing) (OKF v0.1) knowledge bundles — via a CLI and an MCP server.**

An OKF bundle is a directory of Markdown files; each file is one *concept* (YAML
frontmatter + body), the file path is its id, and relative Markdown links form a
knowledge graph. `okf-kit` is an agent-native toolkit for that format: a pure
Python core exposed two ways — the **`okf` CLI** and the **`okf-mcp`** MCP server
(the universal layer for Claude Code, Antigravity, and any MCP client) — plus an
**`okf-search`** skill and an **`okf-author`** skill. No web app, no
REST/GraphQL.

> OKF is "what knowledge looks like once loaded" — designed for LLMs, not
> SPARQL engines. `okf-kit` makes a folder of Markdown queryable, citeable, and
> agent-addressable.

## Install

Requires Python ≥ 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended).

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

This creates a `.venv/` and installs two console entry points — **`okf`** (CLI)
and **`okf-mcp`** (server) — into `.venv/bin/` (not your global `PATH`). Run them
with `uv run`, or activate the venv first:

```bash
uv run okf --help            # prefix with `uv run` …
source .venv/bin/activate    # …or activate once, then use `okf` / `okf-mcp` bare
```

> **No uv?** `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e ".[dev]"`
> installs the same `okf` and `okf-mcp` commands.

The examples below use `uv run`; drop the prefix if you've activated the venv.

## Install agent skills

Install the OKF Agent Skills into a project-local agent configuration:

```bash
uv run okf agent install claude-code --scope project
uv run okf agent install codex --scope project
```

Project scope writes:

- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/{okf-search,okf-author}/SKILL.md`
- Codex: `.codex/skills/{okf-search,okf-author}/SKILL.md`

Use `--dry-run` to preview writes and `--update` to refresh files previously
installed by OKF. This installs skills only: `okf-search` for read-only
progressive context and `okf-author` for create/update authoring loops,
including evidence-backed implementation wikis for code repositories. It does
not install subagents, hooks, MCP config, or plugins.

Run project-scope installs from the repository where you want the skills
available. The installer refuses to write inside an OKF bundle root or
subdirectory so agent skills do not become knowledge concepts by accident. Use
`--scope user` to install into the user-level agent skill directory instead.

## Quick start (build a knowledge base)

```bash
uv run okf init mykb --name "My Knowledge Base"
uv run okf new mykb Table tables/users --title "Users" --desc "User accounts."
uv run okf new mykb Metric metrics/churn --title "Churn" --desc "Monthly churn, see [users](../tables/users.md)."

uv run okf validate mykb                       # SPEC §9 conformance (exit 1 if not conformant)
uv run okf search mykb churn                   # full-text search
uv run okf read mykb metrics/churn --depth 1   # progressive context: concept + neighborhood
uv run okf index regen mykb                    # regenerate per-directory index.md
```

Built-in concept types: `Table`, `Metric`, `Runbook`, `Playbook`, `API` (or any
custom value). The only required frontmatter field is `type`.

## Use it from an agent (MCP)

Start the server over stdio (it registers the bundle by its directory name):

```bash
uv run okf-mcp mykb
```

For Claude Code, add an MCP server config (`.mcp.json`). Point `uv` at this repo
and at your bundle (absolute paths):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "okf": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "/absolute/path/to/okf", "okf-mcp", "/absolute/path/to/mykb"]
    }
  }
}
```

(If you installed `okf-mcp` onto your `PATH` via pip, the config simplifies to
`"command": "okf-mcp", "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mykb"]`.)

## Browse in a browser (`okf serve`)

On demand, launch a read-only web UI over a bundle — tree navigation, search, the
graph, and a Markdown reader with backlinks. It binds `127.0.0.1`, picks a free
port, prints the URL, and runs until you stop it (Ctrl-C). It is **not** started
by `okf-mcp`; an agent harness runs it when a human wants the visual UI.

```bash
uv run okf serve mykb
# -> okf serve: 'mykb' at http://127.0.0.1:54321  (Ctrl-C to stop)
```

Then open the printed URL. Editing (frontmatter form, Markdown editor, CRUD) is
the next milestone; this is read-only.

The server exposes five tools — **`search`**, **`read_concept`** (with `depth`
for progressive context), **`validate`**, plus **`create_concept`** (enforces a
richness floor: ≥120 words + a depth section, so MCP-authored concepts are rich
by construction) and **`init_bundle`** — and an `okf://<bundle>/concepts/<id>.md`
resource per concept.

## Architecture

One pure core, two thin presentation layers (no duplicated logic):

```
okf_kit.core  (model · parse · validate · links · search · context · index · templates)
      │
      ├── okf_kit.cli   → `okf` CLI      (argparse: init/new/validate/search/read/index)
      └── okf_kit.mcp   → `okf-mcp`      (FastMCP/stdio: search/read_concept/validate + okf://)
```

The core is pure: deterministic, no network, no randomness. **Security:** every
caller-supplied concept id and link target is confined to the bundle root
(segment-regex validation + resolved-path containment, including symlink
escapes), on both the read and write paths.

## Status

**v0.1 — build + use a single OKF bundle.** In scope: parse/validate (SPEC §9),
search, progressive-context read, `init`/`new`/`index regen`, the MCP server,
the `okf-search` and `okf-author` skills, and **`okf serve`** — a read-only
browser UI (tree, search, graph, reader) launched on demand by an agent harness.
**Next:** web-UI editing
(frontmatter form, Markdown editor, link autocomplete, CRUD) and bundle
import/export. **Later milestones (see the [`project/backlog`](wiki/project/backlog.md) wiki concept):** producer
(extract/enrich), governance (RBAC/PII/signing), and multi-bundle federation —
including the future multi-level `<domain>/<subdomain>` bundles the design
anticipates. **Git integration** is the only intentionally-deferred Phase-2 item.
