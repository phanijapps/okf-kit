"""Relative-link extraction, resolution, and the path-containment guard.

Builds the OKF knowledge-graph edges from **relative AND absolute
(bundle-relative)** Markdown links (SPEC §5). External (``://``) links are not
edges; broken and out-of-bundle links are dropped silently (SPEC §5.3).

SECURITY: every caller-supplied concept id and every link target is resolved
and confined to the bundle root. ``..`` traversal, absolute paths, and symlink
escapes cannot read files outside the root. Defense in depth — segment-regex
validation rejects ``..``/``/`` lexically, and a resolved-path containment
check rejects anything that escapes (including symlinks).
